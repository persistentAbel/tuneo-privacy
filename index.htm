  <p>Tuneo (“the App”) is an AI-powered music and lyrics generation tool that allows users to create songs using artificial intelligence. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it is used, and your choices regarding that information.</p>

Specifically, we do NOT collect: name, email address, phone number, account information, location data, contact list, photos, videos, device files, sensitive personal data, advertising identifiers, analytics, or device identifiers.</p>

  <h2>2. AI-Generated Content (Lyrics + Music Processing)</h2>
  <p>When users submit lyrics or text for music generation, input is processed securely through our endpoint on Vercel and forwarded to Replicate or other AI models only to fulfill the user’s request. Tuneo does not store or log user content and does not use it for training.</p>

  <h2>3. Local Storage (Songs Saved on Device)</h2>
