  <p>Tuneo (“the App”) is an AI-powered tool that allows users to generate music and lyrics. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how it is used, and your choices regarding that information.</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do NOT Collect</h2>
  <p>Tuneo does not collect, store, or share any personal information. Specifically, we do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>

    <li>Any sensitive personal information</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. AI Content Processing</h2>
  <p>When you enter text or lyrics to generate music, your input is sent to third-party service providers solely to process your request and produce the AI-generated content. These providers do not receive personal identifying information. We do not store your input or use it to train AI models.</p>

  <h2>3. Local Storage (Saved Songs)</h2>
  <p>Generated music files are saved <strong>locally on your device</strong>. They are not uploaded or shared. You may delete this data at any time by removing the App from your device or clearing its storage through your device settings.</p>

  <h2>4. Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>The App uses a third-party service to manage in-app purchases and subscriptions. This service processes anonymous purchase receipts to verify your active subscription. No personal information is collected, stored, or associated with these receipts.</p>

  <h2>5. No Ads and No Tracking</h2>
  <p>Tuneo does not display any third-party advertising, does not use tracking technologies, and does not track users across apps or websites.</p>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
